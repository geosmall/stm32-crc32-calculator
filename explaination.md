The terminology around CRC32, `crc32b`, and hardware-accelerated CRC (like STM32’s peripheral) can be confusing, especially because people and tools often mix up terms.

Here’s a focused breakdown:

---

## 1. **Classic CRC32 ("CRC-32" or "Ethernet/ZIP/IEEE 802.3 CRC32")**

* **Polynomial:** `0x04C11DB7` (standard, reflected as `0xEDB88320`)
* **Bit order:** Operates on *reflected* bits (LSB-first).
* **Initial value:** `0xFFFFFFFF`
* **Input reflected:** **Yes** (i.e., the bits of each byte are reversed before processing)
* **Output reflected:** **Yes**
* **Final XOR value:** `0xFFFFFFFF`
* **Common usage:** Ethernet, PKZIP, zlib, PNG, STM32Cube HAL `HAL_CRC32` (when configured appropriately).

#### **Algorithm Steps:**

1. Initialize CRC register to all 1s (`0xFFFFFFFF`).
2. For each byte:

   * Reverse the bits of the byte (if using reflected algorithm).
   * XOR the byte with the CRC register (usually LSB).
   * For each of 8 bits, if the LSB is set, shift right and XOR with polynomial, else just shift right.
3. After all bytes, reflect the CRC result bits (if applicable).
4. XOR with `0xFFFFFFFF`.

## 2. **CRC32B (sometimes called "Big-endian" CRC32)**

* **Common context:** OpenSSL’s `crc32b`, some BSD tools.
* **Difference:** *Bit order and byte order* may differ.
* **Details:** The term "`crc32b`" is misleadingly used in some tools, like PHP’s `hash('crc32b', ...)` or OpenSSL’s `crc32b` command. In reality, these almost always refer to the **same algorithm as "classic" CRC32**, but output is formatted differently (big-endian output as opposed to little-endian).
* **So:** **In practice, “crc32b” and classic “crc32” are the same calculation, but output order/representation might be different (endianness or hex string format).**

---

## 3. **STM32 CRC Hardware Peripheral**

STM32 MCUs (all recent ones) have a built-in CRC peripheral that can be used to calculate CRCs in hardware. However, **by default, STM32’s CRC peripheral uses the same polynomial (`0x04C11DB7`) but does NOT reflect input or output** (i.e., it is a *non-reflected* algorithm).

* **Polynomial:** `0x04C11DB7`
* **Bit order:** *Not reflected* (MSB-first).
* **Initial value:** `0xFFFFFFFF` (can be configured in some STM32 families)
* **Input reflected:** **No** (unless configured; default is NO)
* **Output reflected:** **No**
* **Final XOR value:** Often not applied by default in hardware, but you can XOR manually.

**Key Point:**

* If you want your STM32 CRC peripheral to be 100% compatible with zlib/Ethernet/ZIP CRC32 (i.e., classic CRC32), you must manually:

  * Reflect the bytes before feeding them to the hardware,
  * Possibly reflect the final CRC result,
  * XOR with `0xFFFFFFFF` as a post-processing step.

**STM32 HAL has `HAL_CRCEx_Polynomial_Set()` and input/output reversal configuration in newer MCUs to help with this.**

## **Key Pitfalls/Takeaways**

* **If you use STM32 CRC hardware and want ZIP/Ethernet compatibility:**

  * Use input and output reflection options (if available), or pre/post-process your data accordingly.
  * XOR the result with `0xFFFFFFFF` after calculation.
* **Most software CRC32 implementations (zlib, CRC32 in Python, etc.) use reflected input/output and the `0x04C11DB7` polynomial.**
* **“crc32b”** is almost always the same as classic CRC32, just a different output byte order (big-endian).

### **Reference Code Comparison**

#### **Classic CRC32 in C (zlib-style):**

```c
uint32_t crc32(uint8_t* data, size_t len) {
    uint32_t crc = 0xFFFFFFFF;
    for(size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        crc ^= data[i];
        for(int j = 0; j < 8; j++)
            crc = (crc >> 1) ^ (crc & 1 ? 0xEDB88320 : 0);
    }
    return crc ^ 0xFFFFFFFF;
}
```

*(Note: `0xEDB88320` is the reversed polynomial for bitwise reflected calculation)*

#### **STM32 CRC Peripheral (HAL Example)**

```c
uint32_t crc = HAL_CRC_Calculate(&hcrc, (uint32_t*)data, len/4);
// For 8-bit data, you need to pack bytes into 32-bit words.
```

*(May need pre-processing to match zlib/ZIP output, or use reversal settings if hardware supports it.)*

---

## **Summary**

* **Classic CRC32**: "Ethernet", ZIP, zlib, PNG, etc. (reflected, standard).
* **CRC32B**: Just a naming quirk; same as classic CRC32, but sometimes output is big-endian.
* **STM32 CRC**: By default, *not* compatible with classic CRC32. Configure input/output reflection and apply final XOR to match.

If you have a **target compatibility** (e.g., ZIP file, Ethernet CRC), you need to match not just the polynomial, but also reflection and XORs. If you want to use the STM32 hardware CRC for classic CRC32, I can provide code to do the required pre/post-processing for exact compatibility.

Let me know if you want code for a **100% compatible STM32+zlib CRC32** or more specific implementation details!
